# Floodgate Inference for ETV

## Description

This is a collection of scripts in R and Python that reproduce the experiments and data analysis in Wang, Janson, Lei and Ramdas (2024).
- Simulation data for Figure 2: Figure_2_simulation.ipynb
- Simulation data for Figure 3: Figure_3_simulation.ipynb
- Conjoint analysis for Figure 4: Figure_4_analysis.R
- Simulated conjoint analysis for Figure 5 (appendix): Figure_5_analysis.R

The original data was collected by Ono and Burden (2019). The code for data pre-processing is adapted from the analysis conducted by Ham, Imai and Janson (2024).
